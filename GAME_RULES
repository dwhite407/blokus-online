Blokus Online — Official Game Rules

This version follows the standard **Blokus** rules adapted for two-player online play.

---

OBJECTIVE
Place as many of your 21 game pieces on the board as possible while blocking your opponent’s options.  
The player with the fewest unplaced squares at the end wins.

---

SETUP
- Board size: 14×14 grid (simplified from 20×20)
- Each player has a unique color (Blue / Orange)
- Each player’s first piece must cover their starting corner:
  - Player 1 → (4, 4) --- Presented by a black circle
  - Player 2 → (9, 9) --- Also presented by a black circle

---

GAMEPLAY
- Players take turns placing one piece per turn.
- Pieces **cannot** overlap or go outside the board.
- A new piece **must touch** one of your existing pieces **by a corner only**.
- Your own pieces **cannot touch along an edge**.
- You **may touch** an opponent’s edge or corner freely.

---

ROTATION AND FLIPPING
- Pieces can be rotated or flipped before placement:
  - **Q / E** → rotate left/right (90°)
  - **Z / X** → flip horizontally/vertically
  - **C** → reset flip state
- Once placed, the piece’s orientation is locked.

---

INVALID MOVES
A placement is **invalid** if:
- Any square overlaps an existing piece.
- The piece extends outside the board.
- The piece touches one of your own pieces by an edge.
- It’s your first move but doesn’t cover your starting corner.

---

END OF GAME
The game ends when **neither player can make a valid move**.  
Scores are calculated by counting the **unused squares** in each player’s remaining pieces.  
The **player with the lower total** (fewer unused squares) wins.

---

NOTES
- This version enforces corner-touch rules server-side for fair play.
- The full 21 Blokus pieces are implemented.
- Planned updates: score UI, piece count, and post-game summary.
